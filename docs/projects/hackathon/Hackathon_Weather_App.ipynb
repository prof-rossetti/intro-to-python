        "\n",
        "Write a Python program to display a weather forecast for any given zip code in the United States. The program should specifically obtain its forecast data from the **Weather.gov API** (see \"References\" section below for more info). \n",
        "\n",
        "## Information Inputs\n",
        "\n",
        "The program should allow the user to input or otherwise specify their **zip code** (a.k.a. postal code) (e.g. `20057`). \n",
        "\n",
        "> FYI: Using and modifying the provided `ZIP_CODE` variable is fine! Because the input function can be buggy sometimes on Colab.\n",
        "\n",
        "> NOTE: ideally we would validate this input to ensure it is numeric in nature (which you can optionally do), but for this project we can just assume the user will be providing a valid zip code.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Information Outputs\n",
        "\n",
        "The program should display a seven-day weather forecast for the provided zipcode. Specifically, it should display **one forecast per day**. HINT: we might need to filter out the night-time forecasts, based on the period's \"isDaytime\" or \"name\" properties.\n",
        "\n",
        "The forecast for any daily period should include at least the following information:\n",
        "\n",
        "   + The **day of week** (e.g. \"Today\", \"Tuesday\", \"Wednesday\", etc.). HINT: we can use the period's \"name\" property.\n",
        "   + The **human-readable date** (e.g. \"2022-01-10\" or \"Jan 10, 2022\"). HINT: we might need to use [the `datetime` module](https://github.com/prof-rossetti/intro-to-python/blob/master/notes/python/modules/datetime.md) to convert the the period's \"startTime\" property to a datetime object (see two possible approaches in the \"Setup\" section of this notebook), and then use [the `strftime()` method](https://docs.python.org/3/library/datetime.html#strftime-and-strptime-format-codes) to do some custom formatting.\n",
        "   + The **temperature** in Farhenheit, with the temperature unit (e.g. \"64 degrees F\"). HINT: we can use the period's \"temperature\" and \"temperatureUnit\" properties.\n",
        "   + The **weather condition** (e.g. \"Sunny\",  \"Mostly Clear\", \"Partly Cloudy\", \"Rainy\", etc.). HINT: we can use the period's \"shortForecast\" or \"longForecast\" property.\n",
        "\n",
        "Separately, the program should also explicitly tell the user **whether or not there will be rain today**. So the user can know whether or not to bring an umbrella with them today. For example, printing either \"NO RAIN TODAY!\" or \"RAIN TODAY!\".\n",

To acheive this, the program can either A) display a maximum of 24 hourly periods, or B) specifically filter out / exclude any periods happening after the current day. \n",
        "\n",
        "> HINT: for approach B, try first obtaining a date object for the current day's date, converting it to a string, and checking if that date substring exists in the period's \"startTime\" property.\n",
