# Data Science "Freestyle" Project

This project provides students with an opportunity to collect and analyze a dataset to follow their own personal or professional interests.


## Groups

Students have the option of working by themselves, or in groups. The professor will announce the range of valid group sizes for your specific class.

To fairly evaluate groups of different sizes, projects may be ranked against others of the same group composition (e.g. solo projects vs other solo projects, two-person teams vs other two-person teams, etc.).

To incentivize individual effort within groups, each group member may be asked to submit a form describing and rating the roles and relative contributions of all other group members.

## Deliverables

There are three main phases to the project: Data Collection, Data Analysis, and Presentation. Each phase has its own set of deliverables.

### Data Collection

Collect a dataset from the Internet. Ideally collect your own custom novel dataset using either an API or a web scraping approach. It may be alternatively possible to obtain a dataset from Kaggle or an open data portal, but it should be a real world dataset and not a toy or example dataset. Primary guidance is to choose any dataset that you think is super fun, interesting, and engaging, and will lend itself well to analysis. Create a Python notebook or code repository to perform the collection (i.e. the "Collection Notebook"), as applicable.

Store the data in a datastore such as a CSV file or a database. Can use a local database or hosted solution like Google Sheets or Google BigQuery. May use a single CSV file / database table, or multiple CSV files / database tables, as applicable. You should be able to share access to your dataset with the professor, and/or with other students.

Create a Data Dictionary document describing the dataset you collected. The Data Dictionary should mention how the dataset was collected, and provide a URL pointing to the original source. The Data Dictionary should also include a list of each field or column in your dataset, along with the datatype and corresponding description of what that column means (and if there are any specific values, what they mean as well). The goal of the Data Dictionary is to allow another researcher to understand what the dataset is about and how to engage with it for analysis purposes.

Deliver: your **Collection Notebook** document in IPYNB format, your **Dataset** in CSV file or database format, as well as the corresponding **Data Dictionary** document in PDF format.

### Data Analysis

Perform analysis on the data. Create a Python notebook or code repository to analyze the data (i.e. the "Analysis Notebook"). It should produce charts, graphs, tables, and any other insights, as applicable, to tell a story about the data.

Your analysis should include some high level exploratory analysis, such as the distribution of certain variables (consider using histogram, box plot, violin plot, etc.). Your analysis should also ideally include a statistical analysis component (e.g. correlation), as applicable. If you can perform some machine learning task (e.g. regression, classification, dimensionality reduction, natural language processing) on the data as well, as applicable, that will be ideal. Different datasets may be more or less suitable for different tasks, so feel free to consult with the professor about what types of analyses are most applicable for your specific dataset. 

Finally, package up your analysis results into a written report. It should tell a story about the data. Embed any applicable charts and graphs as produced by your Python code. The written report should be polished, thoughtful, organized, and free of typographical or grammatical errors. It should use section headings and a corresponding Table of Contents, as applicable.

Deliver: your **Analysis Notebook** document in IPYNB format, as well as the **Final Written Report** in PDF format. 

### Presentation

Finally, create a slideshow presentation summarizing the results, and deliver it to the class during the designated project demo day. Your presentation should be around five to seven minutes in length. It is nice, but not required, for all members to have a speaking role.

Deliver: your **Slides** in PDF format, and your synchronous or asynchronous **Presentation**. Optionally pre-record a video of your presentation (for example using Zoom) and post the MP4 file to YouTube.
