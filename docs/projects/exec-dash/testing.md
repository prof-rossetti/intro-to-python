## "Exec Dash" Project - Automated Testing Challenges

## Formatting Prices

Refactor price-formatting logic into a function called something like `to_usd()`, and implement a corresponding test called something like `test_to_usd()`.

Test various scenarios to ensure the price formatting function displays a dollar sign, two decimal places, and a thousands separator.

## Identifying Top Sellers

Refactor top-selling product identification logic into a function called something like `get_top_sellers()`, and implement a corresponding test called something like `test_top_sellers()`.

Include an example valid monthly sales CSV file somewhere in your test directory, and have your test read the sales data from this file.

Test to ensure the function converts the example sales data into a list of top selling products. What should the resulting data structure look like?
