# "Freestyle" Project - Demonstration

> See: [The "Freestyle" Project](README.md)

## Learning Objectives

  + Show-off your hard work to the rest of the class.
  + Practice communicating technology concepts at a high-level for an audience of potentially-non-technical individuals.
  + Learn more about the other student projects, share knowledge with each other, and celebrate in each other's successes.

## Instructions

Prepare a five minute presentation to share your project with the rest of the class. It should be in Google Slides or MS PowerPoint format, and should generally include the following slides / components (see "Sections" below for more details):

  1. Introduction
  2. Problem Statement / User Needs
  3. Proposed Solution / Info Requirements
  4. Live Demo
  5. Reflections (optional)

Record your presentation using a tool like Zoom, then submit your presentation slideshow and video file(s) as instructed.

## Sections

### Introduction

Introduce yourself and your project's name and subject matter.

### Problem Statement / User Needs

Describe the problem addressed by your project. Who are the affected users and what are their needs?

### Proposed Solution / Info Requirements

Describe your proposed solution to the problem, including a high-level [Data Flow Diagram (DFD)](./../../exercises/data-flow-diagramming/README.md). What does it do? At a high-level, describe how it works, how users interact with it, and any other services or platforms it interfaces with.

### Live Demo

Transition into a live demonstration of your project in action. If for some reason you have not yet completed your project, choose a small component to demo, or demo the results of your investigation efforts into the system's technical feasibility.

### Reflections

Remark on your reactions to the process. For example, you might address the following questions:

  + What was the hardest part of the planning and/or implementation processes? Did you run into any unforeseen issues?
  + How did you prioritize features? For groups, how did you split up the work?
  + What did you learn while working on this project? How did you learn what you needed to learn? Did you find any helpful resources?
  + What went well, and/or what would you do differently next time?
  + What are your next steps, if any?

## Submission Instructions

The professor will assign your group to present on a designated "Demo Day" and time. The professor will designate whether presentations will be given in-person, or remotely via Zoom. The professor will also designate whether presentations will be pre-recorded, or delivered synchronously. See instructions below according to the guidance you're given.

Before 11:59pm on the day before your designated demo day, upload a PDF version of your presentation document (and a copy of your prerecorded Zoom video .mp4 file) as instructed.


### Synchronous Delivery Guidance

If presenting in-person:

  1. During the first few minutes of class on your designated demo day, practice connecting your computer to the projector using either of the provided VGA or HDMI cables.
  2. After the group scheduled to present before you starts to take questions, begin setting up your computer by connecting it to the projector and preparing to demo.
  3. During your designated demo time, deliver your presentation in front of the class. When you are finished, step to the side to answer questions while the next group sets up.

Otherwise if presenting remotely via Zoom:

  1. Before your designated demo day, invite a friend to your own Zoom meeting and practice your ability to connect and screen share.
  2. After the group scheduled to present before you starts to take questions, mentally prepare to start your demo. Make sure your screen is suitable to start sharing.
  3. During your designated demo time, deliver your presentation in front of the class. When you are finished, prepare to answer questions as moderated by the professor.

> NOTE: students in different time zones who are not able to present during the designated Demo Day should pre-record their presentation via Zoom and share the recording file(s) with the professor at least one day in advance of the designated Demo Day (see "Asynchronous Delivery" section).

### Asynchronous Delivery

If recording your presentation asynchronously:

  1. Before your designated demo day, record your presentation via Zoom.
  2. Before your designated demo day, upload the video file(s) or share them with the professor as instructed.
  3. Sit back during demo day as the professor plays your prerecorded demo. Note the professor may play the video on a faster speed if the video is longer than desired.


## Evaluation

Presentations will be evaluated on the basis of content and delivery. Students should strive to deliver presentations with clarity and confidence. Impressive and memorable demonstrations are a great way to earn top grades. 

The professor may ask other individuals in the audience (like TAs or the rest of the class) to evaluate the presentations, in which case these evaluations may likely be factored into the final presentation grade.
