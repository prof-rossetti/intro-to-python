# The "API Client" Project

This project provides students with an opportunity to create software to suit their own personal or professional interests.

## Scope and Complexity

The project's scope should be roughly equivalent to the previous projects, or greater if desired.

## Requirements

The app should transform information inputs into information outputs for some practical purpose. Specifically, it should process data from one or more APIs or other open data sources.

## Groups

Students have the option of working by themselves, or in groups.

To fairly evaluate groups of different sizes, projects may be ranked against others of the same group composition (e.g. solo projects vs other solo projects, two-person teams vs other two-person teams, etc.).

To incentivize individual effort within groups, each group member may be asked to submit a form describing and rating the roles and relative contributions of all other group members.

## Deliverables

  1. Group Formation Sheet
  2. [Implementation](implementation.md)
  3. [Demonstration](demo.md)
