## Version Control Utilities

The goal of a "version control" tool is to help us track changes in our code, and easily interface with code hosting and collaboration platforms like GitHub.

Git is a leading system for performing version control. Professionals may prefer to use Git from the command line, but there is a learning curve. So beginners are encouraged to get started with GitHub Desktop first, which provides an easier to use graphical user interface (GUI).


### GitHub Desktop

All students are encouraged to install [GitHub Desktop software](https://desktop.github.com/), for Mac or Windows.

After installing, you will need to login with your GitHub account credentials. See this [GitHub Desktop setup guide](https://docs.github.com/en/desktop/installing-and-authenticating-to-github-desktop/setting-up-github-desktop), and the professor's [GitHub Desktop configuration reference](/notes/devtools/github-desktop.md#configuration) for more details.

> NOTE: GitHub Desktop may require the Git command line utility to be installed on your computer (see below)

### Git CLI

Installing Git depends on your operating system:

  + Windows users who have [installed Git Bash](/exercises/local-dev-setup/setup-terminal.md) will have satisfied the Git installation requirement.
  + Mac users may find that a system version of Git is already installed, and that might be sufficient to satisfy the Git installation requirement. Any Mac users who encounter errors or who desire a newer version of Git can consider [installing Homebrew](/notes/clis/brew.md), and [using Homebrew to install Git](/notes/clis/git.md#installation-on-mac).


Verifing Git has been installed:

```sh
git --version
```
