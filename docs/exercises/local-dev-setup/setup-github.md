## GitHub

We'll use GitHub to manage, share, and submit different versions of our software projects, called "repositories".

Unless you already have one, take a moment to [create a GitHub account](https://github.com/).

Afterwards, consider signing up for the [GitHub Student Developer Pack](https://education.github.com/pack), which provides some free resources.

> PRIVACY OPTIONS: Many students wish to associate their personal identities with their GitHub accounts, to display a portfolio of programming projects. However, if you're concerned about privacy, you have a few options. First, consider choosing a GitHub username which is different than your university-issued net identifier. Second, avoid uploading any personally-identifiable information to your GitHub profile. Third, consider submitting projects via private repositories.

If successful, when you view this page on GitHub, you should be able to click the buttons on the top-right of the page to "Star" the course repository, and also "Fork" it (i.e. create a copy under your own control).
