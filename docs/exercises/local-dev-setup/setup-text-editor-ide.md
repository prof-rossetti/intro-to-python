## Text Editor

The goal is to have access to a text-editing application of choice, which we'll use to create and edit files of Python code (i.e. text files written in the Python Language and ending in the ".py" extension).

Unless you already have a text editor of choice, install [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/). After installing VS Code, take some time to explore the settings and the "Command Palette". You're encouraged to review the professor's [VS Code configuration reference](/notes/devtools/vs-code.md#basic-configuration) for more details, tips, and tricks.

> NOTE: it may be possible to use alternative text editors like Sublime or integrated development environments (IDEs) like [PyCharm](/notes/devtools/pycharm.md) instead of VS Code, however the professor will be supporting VS Code. Not all tools will allow us to do everything we need to do, and students adopting alternative tools are responsible for learning how to use them. Ultimately it is up to each developer to adopt their own preferences, and it may be helpful and natural to explore a few options as part of the process.
