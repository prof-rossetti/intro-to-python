## Command-line Application

The goal is to have access to a command-line application, which we'll use to programmatically interface with our computers. Choice of tool depends on your operating system:

  + Mac users who don't already have a preferred command-line application are encouraged to use the built-in Terminal application (no need to download anything, although you may want to [customize](/exercises/command-line-computing/mac-terminal-config.md) the Terminal appearance as desired)
  + Windows users who don't already have a preferred command-line application are encouraged to install [Git Bash](https://git-scm.com/downloads), which will allow Windows users to write the same unix-style commands as Mac users

If successful, you should be able to use your command-line application to complete the ["Command-line Computing" Exercise](/exercises/command-line-computing/README.md), which will introduce you to useful commands (like these, for navigating your local filesystem):

```sh
cd ~/Desktop
pwd
ls -al
```
