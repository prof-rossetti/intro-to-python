# "Codebase Cleanup" Exercise (Financial Data Dashboards Version)


## Instructions

Follow along with our in-class progress to simplify, refactor and test our Unemployment Report app, including branch operations and pull request workflow.

## Evaluation

For full points, includes:

  + Automated checks from GitHub Actions, with tests passing on CI
  + Evidence of branch operations and at least one merged Pull Request

Optionally also:

  + Include a PR review / comments from a classmate :-)

## Submission Instructions

Make sure you've uploaded / pushed your most recent code to GitHub before submitting. Merge into the main branch any Pull Requests / branches that you want to be included for evaluation.

Submit the Repository URL via the Deliverable Submission Form, unless you're extending from a previously submitted repository, in which case there is no need to resubmit unless you'd like to.
