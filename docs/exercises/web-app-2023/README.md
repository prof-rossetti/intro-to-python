# "Web App" Exercise (Financial Data Dashboards Version)

## Prerequisites

 + Local Development Exercise (Financial Version) -- converting a prototype notebook to a repository
 + [Codebase Cleanup Exercise (Financial Version)](/exercises/codebase-cleanup-2023/README.md)
 + Web Service Exercise (Financial Version) -- sending emails not necessary, but you'll want to have at least deployed the code to the server

## Learning Objectives

  + Create a basic web application in Python, using modular architecture.
  + Write routing logic to handle GET and POST requests, and respond by rendering HTML pages or returning JSON data.
  + Gain exposure to HTML templates, and using HTML forms to submit form data.
  + Run a web application in "development" using a local web server, and deploy to a user-facing "production" environment (i.e. a Heroku server).

## Prompt

So, you've created a command-line application. Now let's build a web application interface into your application's functionality!


## Instructions

### Setup

To use the Flask package, let's first add `flask` to the repo's "requirements.txt" file, then re-install packages:

```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Guided Checkpoints

Now follow these sequential "checkpoints" to develop the Flask application from scratch, using an iterative process:

  1. [Checkpoint 1](checkpoint-1/) - Basic Routing, Rendering HTML pages
  2. [Checkpoint 2](checkpoint-2/) - Shared Layouts
  3. [Checkpoint 3](checkpoint-3/) - Twitter Bootstrap Layout
  4. [Checkpoint 4](checkpoint-4/) - Interactive Dashboards
  5. [Checkpoint 5](checkpoint-5/) - Automated Testing for Web Apps

For further reference, here is a [completed version history](https://github.com/s2t2/unemployment-2023-testing-prep/pull/1/commits) which implements these checkpoints. 


### Running the Web App

FYI: we'll be running the application using the following Flask command (not a Python command):

```sh
# Mac OS:
FLASK_APP=web_app flask run

# Windows OS:
# ... if `export` doesn't work for you, try `set` instead
# ... or try a ".env" file approach
export FLASK_APP=web_app
flask run
```

To restart the server, press "ctrl+c" to stop it, and then re-run using the command above.

### Deploying to Production

See the [Deployment Checkpoint](deployment/). Add a copy of the provided "DEPLOYING.md" file to the root directory of your repo.

Update your "requirements.txt" file to include the `gunicorn` package, which will be used to run the app in production.

Save all files and make a commit and push the files to GitHub.

Finally, follow the instructions in the "DEPLOYING.md" guide to configure a Render server to host your app. Afterwards, you should be able to view your app in the browser and share the URL with friends and family.
