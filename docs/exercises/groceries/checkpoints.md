## Guided Checkpoints

The "checkpoint" steps below provide one example strategy for breaking-up the [requirements](README.md) into smaller, more manageable pieces. Feel free but not obligated to follow the checkpoints below, working through one step at a time (and optionally making a "commit") before moving on to the next.

  2. Print the number of products.
  3. Print the first product.
  4. Print the name of the first product.

  6. Print in alphabetical order the name of each product.
  7. Print in alphabetical order the name and price of each product.
