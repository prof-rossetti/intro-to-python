# "Run the App" Exercise (Tic Tac Toe Version)

> See the ["Run the App" Exercise](README.md) description.


## Instructions

  1. Visit the Professor's ["Tic Tac Toe" repository](https://github.com/s2t2/tic-tac-toe-py), which contains a simple command-line game. We'll refer to the Professor's repository as the "upstream repository".
  2. Click "Fork" to copy the repo under your own control (selecting the "for my own purposes" option, if prompted on GitHub Desktop). We'll refer to your forked copy as the "remote fork", otherwise known as the "origin repository".
  3. Follow the instructions in the repository's "README.md" file to install, setup and run the Python code contained inside:
     1. Use your Git client to "clone" (download) the remote fork onto your local machine, perhaps onto the Desktop. We'll refer to this as the "local repository".
     2. Use the command-line to navigate to the local repository (using one or more `cd` commands).
     3. Use the `conda` utility to create a new virtual environment with the specified version of Python, then activate the virtual environment.
     4. Use the `pip` utility to install any required third-party packages specified in the repo's "requirements.txt" file.
     5. Use the `python` utility to run the Python file(s) as described in the README's "Usage" section.

## Success Criteria

Once you have played a single game, you will have succeeded.

For fun, try replaying the game against different kinds of opponents (computer, human, etc.).

## Further Exploration

Optionally simulate many games between computer players, and see the CSV file of game outcomes that gets produced.

Practice passing environment variables to customize the game count and player types.
