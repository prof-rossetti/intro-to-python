# "Run the App" Exercise (Daily Briefings Version)

> See the ["Run the App" Exercise](README.md) description.

## Instructions

Are you ready to run a real app that actually does something? Try the professor's ["Daily Briefings" repository](https://github.com/prof-rossetti/daily-briefings-py), which contains a command-line application for fetching weather forecasts, and sending weather forecast emails.

Just like before, we'll fork and clone the repo, then start to follow it's README instructions. Follow the Installation instructions, using a process like the one described above.

Your main goal is to then run the "Weather Service" Python script (does not require any Configuration steps - can skip that section for now). If successful, you should see weather forecast results in the terminal.

After that, your stretch goal is to follow the Configuration instructions (related to signing up for a Sendgrid account and configuring environment variables), then run the "Email Service" and "Daily Briefing" Python scripts. If successful, you should see weather forecast results sent to your email address.

Ignore the sections about Testing and Deploying. They're a little out of scope for us right now.
