# "Web Service" Exercise - Further Exploration

## New User Registration

Create a Google Form to capture new user registrations, including their email address, zip code, etc.

Then ensure this user data is being stored in a corresponding Google Sheet.

Leverage [the `gspread` package](/notes/python/packages/gspread.md) to read user data from the Google Sheet, and update the application's functionality to send a daily briefing email to all registered users!

Talk to your users to gather feedback and see how much they'd pay for new features! :smiley_cat:
