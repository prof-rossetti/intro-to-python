# "Monthly Sales Predictions" Exercise

> WARNING: intended for students with experience and interest in statistics

## Setup

Use the same repo with monthly sales CSV data files you used for the "Monthly Sales Reporting" exercise, or make a copy of that repo called something like "monthly-sales-predictions" and add the same CSV files into that new repo.

Make sure your repo includes all available ["monthly sales data"](/data/monthly-sales) CSV files.

## Instructions

Research and leverage third-party Python packages to predict top-level monthly sales for each of the next twelve months following the latest available month of available data.

## Further Exploration Challenges
