# "Web App" Exercise

## Prerequisites

 + ["Web Service" Exercise](/exercises/web-service/README.md)

## Learning Objectives

  + Create a basic web application in Python, using modular architecture.
  + Write routing logic to handle GET and POST requests, and respond by rendering HTML pages or returning JSON data.
  + Gain exposure to HTML templates, and using HTML forms to submit form data.
  + Run a web application in "development" using a local web server, and deploy to a user-facing "production" environment (i.e. a Heroku server).

## Prompt

So, you've [deployed a background web service](/exercises/web-service/README.md) to send you an email every day. But what if you wanted the information on-demand at the click of a button, without waiting for the next daily email? And what if you wanted to allow other people to register for your service? Let's build a web application interface into your application's functionality!

## Instructions

### Setup

To use the Flask package, let's first add `Flask` to the Daily Briefing repo's "requirements.txt" file, then re-install packages:

```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Guided Checkpoints

Now follow these sequential "checkpoints" for a guided walk-through of how to create a Flask application:

  1. [Getting Started](checkpoints/1-modular-org.md)
  2. [Routing](checkpoints/2-routing.md)
  3. [Rendering HTML Pages](checkpoints/3-render-template.md)
  4. [Web Forms (and Handling POST Requests)](checkpoints/4-web-forms.md)

Stretch goals / further exploration:

  5. [Twitter Bootstrap Styling (and Flash Messaging)](checkpoints/5-bootstrap-layout.md)
  6. Google Login - see this [template repo](https://github.com/prof-rossetti/flask-firebase-template-2022) and feel free to use it for your projects!!!

FYI: we'll be running the application using the following Flask command (not a Python command):

```sh
# Mac OS:
FLASK_APP=web_app flask run

# Windows OS:
# ... if `export` doesn't work for you, try `set` instead
export FLASK_APP=web_app
flask run
```

### Deploying to Production

Reference:
  + [Getting Started w/ Python - Heroku](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/getting-started-with-python)
  + [Deploying Python Apps w/ Gunicorn - Heroku](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/python-gunicorn)

After completing all the checkpoints and demonstrating the ability to successfully run the web app locally, let's re-deploy the source code:

```sh
git push heroku main
```

Heroku says "no web process specified". They want us to create a specific file called the "Procfile" in the repo's root directory to instruct the Heroku server which command to invoke in order to run the web app:

```sh
# this is the Procfile (a Heroku config file)

web: gunicorn "web_app:create_app()"
```

Since we're instructing the server to use the "gunicorn" package (Heroku's preferred tool) to run the web app on production, we'll also need to add `gunicorn` to the "requirements.txt" file so it will be installed on the server during the deployment process.

After saving the "Procfile" and "requirements.txt" files, make a commit before re-attempting to re-deploy:

```sh
git push heroku main
```

View the server logs and troubleshoot as necessary:

```sh
heroku logs --tail
```
