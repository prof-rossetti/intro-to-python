## Learning Objectives

In this exercise, we'll practice using the Google Colab platform for the first time as we gain familiarity with Python notebooks.

## Prerequisites

You're encouraged to review the [Colab notes](./../../notes/devtools/google-colab.md) and reference this [Markdown Guide](https://www.markdownguide.org/).



## Instructions

  1. Use [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/) to create a new notebook document, and give it a title like "My First Notebook".
  2. Update the editor settings using the gear icon in the top right. Tab using four spaces. Show line numbers and indentation guides. Enable code folding. Save your preferences.
  3. Update your notebook's sharing settings so anyone with the link can view.
  4. Create a new text cell and write some markdown in it (like the example markdown below).
  5. Create a code cell and write some Python code in it (like the example code below).
  6. "Run" the notebook to see the output of your code cell.
 

Example markdown:

```
# My First Notebook!

This is a text cell. It uses the markdown language. The line above is a heading, starting with the "#" sign. Remember "#" means something different in Markdown than it does in Python.

We can make links like [this](https://github.com/prof-rossetti/intro-to-python).

And lists too:

  + Item 1
  + Item 2
  + Item 3

For more information about Markdown syntax, see the [Markdown Guide](https://www.markdownguide.org/).
```


Example Python code:

```py
# This is some example Python code
# These lines starting with "#" are "comments"
# Remember "#" means something different in Markdown than it does in Python

print("HELLO WORLD!")

x = 2 + 2
print(x)
```
