# "Rock, Paper, Scissors" Exercise

## Learning Objectives

  + Gain familiarity with the Python programming language, focusing on variables and conditional logic.
  + Learn how to process and validate user inputs in Python.
  + Learn how to import and access functionality provided by built-in Python modules and third-party Python packages.
  + Practice editing, saving, and executing local Python programs.
  + Practice incorporating version control into your local development process.

## Prerequisites

  + ["Run the App" Exercise](/exercises/run-the-app/README.md)
  + Python Language Overview (focusing on [Variables](/notes/python/variables.md) and [Conditionals](/notes/python/control-flow.md))

## Instructions

Iteratively develop a command-line Python application which will allow a human user to play a game of Rock-Paper-Scissors against a computer opponent. The game's functionality should adhere to the "Requirements" below.

Before attempting to implement the basic requirements, take some time to configure your project repository according to the "Setup" instructions below (or use this [RPS Starter Repo](https://github.com/prof-rossetti/rps-starter)). After doing so, you'll have a remote repo on GitHub and a local copy on your computer within which to develop.

When developing, as you reach key milestones, use the command-line or GitHub Desktop software to intermittently "commit", or save new versions of, your code. And remember to push / sync / upload your work back up to your remote project repository on GitHub at least once before you're done.


## Setup

### Repo Setup

Use the GitHub online interface to create a new remote project repository called something like "rock-paper-scissors-exercise". When prompted by the GitHub online interface, let's get in the habit of adding a "README.md" file and a Python-flavored ".gitignore" file (and also optionally a "LICENSE") during the repo creation process. After this process is complete, you should be able to view the repo on GitHub at an address like `https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/rock-paper-scissors-exercise`.

After creating the remote repo, use GitHub Desktop software or the command-line to download or "clone" it onto your computer. Choose a familiar download location like the Desktop.

After cloning the repo, navigate there from the command-line:

```sh
cd ~/Desktop/rock-paper-scissors-exercise
```

Use your text editor or the command-line to create a file in that repo called "game.py", and then place the following contents inside:

```py
# this is the "game.py" file...

print("Rock, Paper, Scissors, Shoot!")
```

Make sure to save Python files like this whenever you're done editing them. After setting up a virtual environment, we will be ready to run this file.

### Environment Setup

> NOTE: if you want, you could do this exercise in the "base" environment! Otherwise, for more practice, we could use a project-specific environment. And certainly if your app ends up requiring any third-party packages, we'll need to use the project-specific environment.

Create and activate a new project-specific Anaconda virtual environment:

```sh
conda create -n my-game-env python=3.8 # (first time only)
conda activate my-game-env
```

From within the virtual environment, demonstrate your ability to run the Python script from the command-line:

```sh
python game.py
```

If you see the "Rock, Paper, Scissors, Shoot!" message, you're ready to move on to project development. This would be a great time to make any desired modifications to your project's "README.md" file (like adding instructions for how to setup and run the app like you've just done), and then make your first commit, with a message like "Setup the repo".

## Requirements

Once you have completed the setup section above, you are ready to tackle the implementation of this exercise, as described by the sections below. To develop good version control habits, aim to make a separate commit after completing each section.

### Processing User Inputs

The application should prompt the user to input, or otherwise select, an option (i.e. "rock", "paper", or "scissors") via command-line interface (CLI). It should store the user's selection in a variable for later reference.

> HINT: use [the `input()` function](/notes/python/inputs.md) to capture user inputs.

### Validating User Inputs

The application should compare the user's selection against the list of valid options (i.e. "rock", "paper", "scissors") to determine whether the user has selected a valid option.

It should be able to handle various capitalizations of the valid options (e.g. "ROCK", "Rock", or "rock").

However if the selection is invalid, the program should fail gracefully by displaying a friendly message to the user, and preventing further program execution. The program should not try to further process an invalid input, as it may lead to runtime errors.

> HINT: use the `exit()` or `quit()` keywords to stop the program.

### Simulating Computer Selection

The application should select one of the options (i.e. "rock", "paper", or "scissors") at random, and assign that as the computer player's choice.

> HINT: use the `choice()` function provided by [the `random` module](/notes/python/modules/random.md).

> HINT: ensure the valid choices are stored in a ["list" datatype](/notes/python/datatypes/lists.md), and then pass that list to the random choice function.

### Determining the Winner

The application should compare the user's selection to the computer player's selection, and determine which is the winner. The following logic should govern that determination:

  1. Rock beats Scissors
  2. Paper beats Rock
  3. Scissors beats Paper
  4. Rock vs Rock, Paper vs Paper, and Scissors vs Scissors each results in a "tie"

> HINT: use one or more [`if` statements](/notes/python/control-flow.md#if-statements) (recommended approach for beginners), or it may also be possible to use a pre-configured ["dictionary" datatype](/notes/python/datatypes/dictionaries.md) containing all possible outcomes.

### Displaying Results

After determining the winner, the application should display the results to the user. Desired information outputs (from start to finish) should include at least the following:

  + A friendly welcome message, including the player's name (by default, use "Player One").
  + The user's selected option
  + The computer's selected option
  + Whether the user or the computer was the winner
  + A friendly farewell message

Example desired output after one round of game-play:

```
-------------------
Welcome 'Player One' to my Rock-Paper-Scissors game...
-------------------
Please choose either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors': rock
You chose: 'rock'
The computer chose: 'paper'
-------------------
Oh, the computer won. It's ok.
-------------------
Thanks for playing. Please play again!
```

## Evaluation

Exercise submissions will be evaluated according to the requirements set forth above, as summarized by the rubric below:

Category | Requirement | Weight
--- | --- | ---
Repository | Includes a README file with detailed instructions, including the appropriate setup instructions, and the exact `conda`, `pip`, and `python` commands needed to run the program from scratch. | 20%
Info Inputs | Instructs the user to provide an input, and then captures and stores that user input. | 10%
Validations | Handles user inputs of various capitalization (i.e. recognizes "rock", "Rock", and "ROCK" as valid inputs). | 10%
Validations | Fails gracefully if encountering an invalid user input (i.e. program does not crash or malfunction if user provides an invalid input, like "OOPS"). | 15%
Calculations | Displays accurate information about which player is the winner. | 15%
Info Outputs | Presents all desired information outputs to the user. | 10%
Dev Process | Submitted via remote Git repository which reflects an incremental revision history with at least a handful of commits. | 20%

It is also possible to earn bonus points by tackling the [Further Exploration Challenges](challenges.md).

This rubric is tentative, and may be subject to slight adjustments during the grading process.

If experiencing execution error(s) while evaluating the application's required functionality, evaluators are advised to reduce the project's grade by between 4% and 25%, depending on the circumstances and severity of the error(s).
