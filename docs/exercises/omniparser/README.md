# Data Processing (a.k.a. "Omniparser") Exercise

# Prerequisites

  + [The `csv` Module](/notes/python/modules/csv.md) ... OR ... [The `pandas` Package](/notes/python/packages/pandas.md)

## Learning Objectives

  + Practice using Python to process differently-formatted files of machine-readable data (e.g. CSV, TXT, JSON, etc.).
  + Practice researching and leveraging the capabilities provided by Python modules and third-party packages.

## Setup

Fork, then clone the professor's ["Omniparser Starter" repo](https://github.com/prof-rossetti/omniparser-starter-py), which contains starter code and all the data files you'll need to perform the exercise. Then follow the setup instructions contained within the "README" file of that repo to create and activate a new virtual environment and prepare for project development.

## Instructions

Follow the instructions contained within the "README" file of that repo. Your goal is to make the respective tests pass by implementing logic to process each of the provided data files.
