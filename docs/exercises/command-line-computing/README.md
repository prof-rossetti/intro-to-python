# "Command-line Computing" Exercise

Before we start learning about Python or software development, it will be helpful for us to achieve a basic level of familiarity with the command-line. Throughout the semester, we will be using the command-line to navigate and manage our computer's filesystem, execute Python scripts, and perform other important tasks using various command-line utilities (CLIs).

Commands can differ based on which operating system and command-line application you're using, but all students are encouraged to learn the prevalent "unix-style" commands:
  + On Mac OS, the default Terminal application will allow students to use unix-style commands.
  + On Windows OS, the default Command Prompt application uses different commands, but installing the Git Bash application will allow students to use unix-style commands.

## Instructions

Follow along with one of the following guides:

  + [Unix Command-Line / Bash](mac-terminal.md) - RECOMMENDED FOR ALL STUDENTS (MAC OR WINDOWS)
  + [Windows Command-Prompt](windows-command-prompt.md) - NOT RECOMMENDED

> TIPS:
