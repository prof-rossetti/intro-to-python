# People

At the heart of any computer-based information system are the people within the system's scope. This includes the system's users, administrators, and anyone else participating in or affected by the processes the system is facilitating or performing.

## User-Centered Design

Because the system exists to help the user, the user's needs should be at the center of a system's design.

> Start with people's needs. Begin projects by conducting research with real people to understand who they are, what they need, and how they behave. Design programs and services around those needs, continuously test with users, and refine policy and processes accordingly. - ["User Centered Design", from the Code for America Playbook, 2018](https://web.archive.org/web/20180720045811/https://www.codeforamerica.org/practices/user-centered-design)

## User Needs

User Needs Statements: "[who] needs [what] so they can [why]".
