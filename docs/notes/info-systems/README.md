# Information Systems

An **Information System** processes one or more **information inputs** into one or more **information outputs** for a specific purpose. Example system diagram:

## Purpose

Information systems can perform numeric computations, facilitate communication and collaboration, automate business processes, and more. Information systems provide value to organizations by providing a competitive advantage in terms of cost, quality, speed, accuracy, and/or scale.

### Information Hierarchy

Sometimes an information system outputs the same or similar information it receives. But more often a system's objective is to transform information inputs into more valuable information outputs. Information has different value, depending on where it falls within the following **Information Hierarchy**:

term | description
--- | ---
**Data** | A description of something, not necessarily organized or synthesized to provide meaning.
**Information** | Data that has been organized or interpreted to provide meaning and value.
**Knowledge** | Data and/or Information that has been organized, processed and interpreted to convey understanding, experience, accumulated learning, expertise, etc.

## Classifications

Information Systems can be classified based on system purpose, functionality, scope, audience, and/or type of information processed:

system type | general functions |  specific example(s)
--- | --- | ---
**Operational** (e.g. Transaction Processing Systems (TPS))| Sends and receives data. | An ATM.
**Managerial** (e.g. Business Intelligence (BI), Management Information Systems (MIS), and some Decision Support Systems (DSS)) | Processes and synthesizes data into information. | A system that produces data dashboards.
**Executive** (e.g. some Decision Support Systems (DSS), Expert Systems, and Machine Learning) | Processes and synthesizes information into knowledge; emulates human decision-making and judgement processes. | A university's Student Housing Selection System, IBM Watson, Tesla Model S, Netflix and Pandora Recommendation Systems.

## Components

Information systems may or may not leverage technology. Examples of non-tech information systems include: a doctor's paper-based patient records system, a deli's paper-based ordering system, and a "tin-can telephone" system.

A computer-based information system uses a related group of technology components working together to process information inputs into information outputs for a specific purpose. Components of a computer-based information system generally include:

component | description
--- | ---
[People](people.md) | Individuals who use the system.
[Processes](processes.md) | Procedures the system performs or facilitates.
[Hardware](../hardware/servers.md) | Physical devices such as computers, servers, sensors, monitors, printers, speakers, etc. which perform as instructed by the system's software.
[Software](../software/README.md) | Written instructions which govern the system's logic.
[Network](networks.md) | Facilitates connection and communication between system components, often a computer network such as the Internet.
[Datastore](datastores.md) | A storage place for the system's information, like a Database or file cabinet.
