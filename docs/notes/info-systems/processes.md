# Processes

Computer-based information systems enable or facilitate some set of defined processes or procedures.

## Process Analysis

The act of describing a process in writing usually leads to a better understanding of that process.

## Process Diagramming

One good way of demonstrating and communicating your understanding of a process is by diagramming it.

**Process Diagrams** depict the flow and scope of a process from start to finish. Process diagrams should ideally be accompanied by written descriptions of the various component sub-processes.

### Process Diagramming Tools

Tools with diagramming capabilities:

  + Word Processing Software (e.g. Google Docs, MS Word)
  + Presentation Software (e.g. Google Slides, MS PowerPoint)
  + [MS Visio](https://products.office.com/en-us/visio/flowchart-software)
  + [Omnigraffle](https://www.omnigroup.com/omnigraffle)
  + [LucidChart](https://www.lucidchart.com/) (recommended)

### Process Diagram Shapes

Process diagrams generally employ a standard set of shapes, each with a specific meaning:

shape | purpose
--- | ---
Circle or Oval | A "terminator" which indicates the start or end steps of the process
Square or Rectangle | A sub-process, or step in the overall process
line with an arrow | Points from one step to another to indicate sequential flow, including sub-process dependencies
Diamond | Denotes a "decision-point" in the process, including conditions under which different outcomes are possible
Square with a squiggly bottom | A "document" produced by, or related to, a step in the process

Additionally, some process diagrams use visual separators called "swim lanes" to indicate which stakeholders are responsible for each sub-process.

## Process Re-engineering

After learning more about the process, analysts are able to identify "pain points", or areas in need of improvement. And they can identify ways to simplify or re-engineer the process.
