        "## Naming\n",
        "\n",
        "Always observe lower-case variable and function names. If your variable or function name is comprised of two words, use snake case, not camel-case. As usual, only use title case for class names. Use snake case for Python (`.py`) files as well.\n",

        "> PROFESSOR'S SIDE-NOTE: When in doubt, use lowercase snake case like `my_var = ...` or `def my_func(): ...` . You'll see me sometimes use all caps variable names like `CSV_FILEPATH = ...` which I think is the cause of some confusion. In other languages, a variable name in all caps like this is a \"constant\", or a variable whose value can't be changed. Although this behavior does not apply to Python, I have carried over this convention into my Python out of habit, perhaps providing you with a poor example. I also generally do this when I'm converting environment variables into Python variables, for consistency there. But this isn't a rule and I encourage each of you to adopt a pattern that makes sense to you!\n",
