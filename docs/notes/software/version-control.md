# Software Version Control

> Version control systems are a category of software tools that help a software team manage changes to source code over time. Version control software keeps track of every modification to the code in a special kind of database. If a mistake is made, developers can turn back the clock and compare earlier versions of the code to help fix the mistake while minimizing disruption to all team members. - [Atlassian website](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/what-is-version-control)
