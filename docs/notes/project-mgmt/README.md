# Technology Project Management

Software development projects usually involve a team of individuals working collaboratively to implement system requirements and satisfy user needs.

Larger scale projects may involve cross-functional teams of designers, developers, business analysts, and other individuals within or outside of a given organization.

As a part of the technology project management process, project leaders and participants often use [Project Management Tools](tools.md) to help them deliver on time and under budget.

And as the scale and scope of the project grows, it becomes more and more important to engage in a formal process of project management, known as the [Systems Development Lifecycle](dev-lifecycle.md).
