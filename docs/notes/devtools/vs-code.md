# The VS Code Text Editor

We'll be writing Python scripts using software called a ["text editor"](https://idrh.ku.edu/text-editors-and-word-processors). Similar to word processing software like Microsoft Word, text editors allow us to write and save documents of text. But unlike word processors, which save extra metadata (e.g. styles and formatting) along with the underling text, text editors allow us to save files comprised of just text. This helps the computer more easily interpret them.

There are many good text editor options out there, including [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/), [Atom](https://atom.io/), [Sublime](https://www.sublimetext.com/), and [Notepad++](https://notepad-plus-plus.org/), and it seems each developer has their own preference.

Regardless of which text editor you choose, you are highly encouraged to configure it with certain plugins, packages and extensions to enhance your experience and save you time. There are two sets of functionality in particular which will prove especially valuable this semester. These are "Python syntax auto-completion" and "column-style selection", respectively (see basic configuration section below).

## Installation

[Download VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/Download).

## Basic Configuration

After you have downloaded VS Code, you'll want to take some time to familiarize yourself with its [settings](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/getstarted/settings) and menus.

The Command Pallete (accessible by typing "shift + command + P") is perhaps the biggest time-saving tool, and is worth exploring.

### Column Selection

If configured, your text editor can also enable vertical text selection. This comes in handy if you have to change multiple lines of text at the same time, including commenting-out many lines at once.

By default, you should be able to achieve column selection functionality in VS Code by pressing "shift + alt" (Windows) or "shift + option" (Mac), then clicking and dragging up or down.

### Shell Commands

On a Windows, you may not need to take any action. But on a Mac, follow [these steps](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/setup/mac#_launching-from-the-command-line) to enable VS Code shell commands.

![](/img/notes/dev-tools/vs-code/vs-code-enable-shell-commands.png)

After enabling shell commands, you should be able to use the `code` command to open files and folders from the command-line:

```sh
# open all files and folders in the current working directory:
code .

# open all files and folders in the specified directory, e.g. "path/to/my-project":
code path/to/my-project
```


### Python Syntax Auto-completion

Once configured, the text editor is capable of automatically completing snippets of Python code for you. This helps improve accuracy, and saves time.

![a screenshot of the text editor's autocomplete functionality](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1328807/50870477-2e02ed80-1386-11e9-9a83-506d9c9d39ec.gif)

When you open a Python file in VS Code, it should prompt you to install the official Python extension (`ms-python.python`). You are recommended to install this extension to enable Python syntax auto-completion.

> NOTE: VS Code has removed many of the helpful auto-complete snippets. So we need to configure our own if we want to use them. Try searching for a plugin related to Python snippets, or configure your own (see "Python Snippets" section below).

> UPDATE: VS Code and the Pylance extension may give you irrelevant autocomplete suggestions. So consider disabling Pylance, and create your own auto-complete snippets instead (see "Python Snippets" section below).

### Python Snippets

Use the command palette and start typing "snippets" to find the "Preferences > Configure User Snippets" setting which should yield a snippets JSON file. Feel free to update yours to include any of these helpful Python snippets:

```
{
	// Place your global snippets here. Each snippet is defined under a snippet name and has a scope, prefix, body and
	// description. Add comma separated ids of the languages where the snippet is applicable in the scope field. If scope
	// is left empty or omitted, the snippet gets applied to all languages. The prefix is what is
	// used to trigger the snippet and the body will be expanded and inserted. Possible variables are:
	// $1, $2 for tab stops, $0 for the final cursor position, and ${1:label}, ${2:another} for placeholders.
	// Placeholders with the same ids are connected.
	// Example:
	// "Print to console": {
	// 	"scope": "javascript,typescript",
	// 	"prefix": "log",
	// 	"body": [
	// 		"console.log('$1');",
	// 		"$2"
	// 	],
	// 	"description": "Log output to console"
	// }

	"Python For Loop": {
		"prefix": ["for"],
		"body": [
			"for item in my_list:",
			"    print(item)"
		],
		"description": "A for loop in Python."
	},
	
	"Python Function Definition": {
		"prefix": ["def"],
		"body": [
			"def my_func():",
			"    pass"
		],
		"description": "A function definition in Python."
	},

	"Python Class Constructor": {
		"prefix": ["init", "__init", "defi"],
		"body": [
			"def __init__(self):",
			"    pass"
		],
		"description": "A class initializer method for Python."
	},

	"Python Try Block": {
		"prefix": ["try"],
		"body": [
			"try:",
			"    pass",
			"except Exception as err:",
			"    print('OOPS', err)"
		],
		"description": "A try block for error-handling in Python. Try to use the specific error class if you know it, instead of Exception."
	},

	"Python Main Conditional": {
		"scope": "python",
		"prefix": ["main", "__main"],
		"body": [
			"if __name__ == '__main__':",
			"    pass"
		],
		"description": "The main conditional for Python."
	}
}
```

## Further Optional Configurations

These are some of the professor's personal VS Code configurations, for your reference. Feel free but not obligated to use them.

### Additional Extensions

A sample of the professor's installed extensions (results from running `code --list-extensions`):

```sh
HookyQR.beautify
mechatroner.rainbow-csv
mikestead.dotenv
ms-python.python
sleistner.vscode-fileutils
streetsidesoftware.code-spell-checker
whizkydee.material-palenight-theme
xamm.filepath
yzhang.markdown-all-in-one
```

You might try searching these manually or [importing them programmatically](https://stackoverflow.com/a/49398449/670433) via `code --install-extension EXTENSION_NAME`, where "EXTENSION_NAME" is the extension's identifier (see list above). For example:

```sh
code --install-extension HookyQR.beautify
code --install-extension mechatroner.rainbow-csv
code --install-extension mikestead.dotenv
code --install-extension ms-python.python
code --install-extension sleistner.vscode-fileutils
code --install-extension streetsidesoftware.code-spell-checker
code --install-extension whizkydee.material-palenight-theme
code --install-extension xamm.filepath
code --install-extension yzhang.markdown-all-in-one
```


### User Settings

Use the command palette and start typing "settings" to find the "Preferences > Open Settings (JSON)" setting which should yield a snippets JSON file. Feel free to update yours to include any of these settings overrides:

```json
{
  "workbench.activityBar.visible": false,
  "workbench.colorTheme": "Palenight Theme",
  "breadcrumbs.enabled": true,
  "editor.fontSize": 14,
  "editor.wrappingIndent": "none",
  "editor.formatOnPaste": true,
  "editor.formatOnType": true,
  "editor.tabSize": 4,
  "explorer.confirmDragAndDrop": false,
  "explorer.confirmDelete": false,
  "files.trimTrailingWhitespace": true,
  "files.insertFinalNewline": true,
  "files.trimFinalNewlines": true,
  "emmet.showSuggestionsAsSnippets": true,
  "diffEditor.ignoreTrimWhitespace": false,
  "window.zoomLevel": 0,
  "telemetry.telemetryLevel": "off",
}
```

If you want to disable Pylance / auto-complete , also include:

```json
  "python.linting.enabled": false,
  "python.languageServer": "None",
 ```
 
### Keybord Shortcuts

Use the command palette and start typing "shortcuts" to find the "Preferences > Open Keyboard Shortcusts (JSON)" setting which should yield a snippets JSON file. Feel free to update yours to include any of these keyboard shortcut overrides:

```json
// Place your key bindings in this file to override the defaults
[
    {
        "key": "cmd+\\",
        "command": "workbench.action.toggleSidebarVisibility"
    },
    {
        "key": "cmd+b",
        "command": "-workbench.action.toggleSidebarVisibility"
    },
    {
        "key": "shift+cmd+d",
