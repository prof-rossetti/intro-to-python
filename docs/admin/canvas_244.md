Here is some updated assignment language used in Fall 2022. We were able to acheive a better pace than previous offerings.

## Command Line Computing

Complete the Command Line Computing Exercises. Take some screenshots of your terminal output along the way, or just at the end. And upload the screenshots here.

Did you get to download any cool YouTube videos using the youtube-dl command-line tool?

## Run the App

Complete the Run the App Exercise, which asks you to run some existing code.

Do the Tic Tac Toe version. Take some screenshots of you playing the game via your terminal, and upload those screenshots here.

Feel free to explore the Daily Briefings version as well, if you'd like to fetch some weather forecast and send emails. Feel free to upload screenshots here if you do.

## Unemployment Report

Follow along with our in-class progress to re-create the Unemployment Report notebook, but using local development tools and a version controlled process. Complete all Challenges A, B, and C. Do at least the CSV or the JSON version, or both. If you do both, use separate files (see solution code).

For full points:

  + your repo's version history should reflect at least a handful of incremental commits (i.e. one commit for fetching the data, another for Challenge A, another for Challenge B, and another commit for Challenge C, etc.)
  + your python script should demonstrate secure usage of environment variables, by reading them from the ".env" file
  + your README file should contain comprehensive instructions (i.e. setup steps, usage commands, etc.) necessary to setup and run the file
  + Make sure you've uploaded / pushed your most recent code to GitHub before submitting.

Submit the Repository URL via the Deliverable Submission Form.

## Unemployment Cleanup

Follow along with our in-class progress to simplify, refactor and test our Unemployment Report app, including branch operations and pull request workflow.

For full points, includes:

  + automated checks from GitHub Actions, with tests passing on CI
  + evidence of branch operations and at least one merged Pull Request

Optionally:

  + include a PR review / comments from a classmate :-)

Make sure you've uploaded / pushed your most recent code to GitHub before submitting. Merge into the main branch any Pull Requests / branches that you want to be included for evaluation.

Submit the Repository URL via the Deliverable Submission Form, unless you're extending from a previously submitted repository, in which case there is no need to resubmit unless you'd like to.

## Unemployment Web

Follow along with our in-class progress to create a web application interface into the unemployment report, and deploy it to a server for hosting.

For full points, deploy the app to a server (you can use Heroku or any other platform). Note the hosted URL.

Submit the repository and hosted URLs via the Deliverable Submission Form.

## Project Investigation and Proposal

### Subject Matter Selection

For your Freestyle Project, you are asked to make a user-facing software application, ideally for business purposes. Choose a subject matter that is interesting to you (from sports, to finance, music and movies, games, etc.). Or think of ways to improve some process you experience in your daily life. If you're stuck and looking for an idea, try searching the web for some data source (i.e. web page or API) of interest, and do something cool / interesting / useful / fun with the data. NOTE: your project doesn't need to focus on data - for example you could alternative make a RPG style game and that would be fine.

### Group Member Selection

For this project you can work by yourself, or in groups of two or three students total. Use the Group Formation Sheet to share project ideas and find group members. When you know who you will be working with, make sure to designate each group member's Net ID in the in the Group Formation Sheet, along with your subject matter of choice. It will be OK to revise your subject matter / pivot later, as necessary.

### Project Investigation / Prototyping

For this Investigation deliverable, explore your ability to make an app related to your proposed subject matter. You will most likely be doing this in notebook format. In a later deliverable we will likely translate your notebook prototype into a more fully-featured GitHub repository.

### Submission Instructions

When you're done with your prototype notebook, only one member of your group needs to submit the Project Proposal Form, listing the email addresses of all group members, answering the questions, and providing the link to your Colab notebook.

### Evaluation

On time submission of the proposal form is worth 5/15 points
The content of your investigation / prototype notebook is worth 10/15 points

Example Prototype Notebook:
  + Market Sentiments App Prototype


## Project Implementation

See the Freestyle Project Implementation deliverable requirements for more details.

Implement a finished version of your project, ideally as a GitHub repository, however if you think a notebook is more desirable, discuss that with the professor.

When you're done, only one member of your group needs to submit the Deliverable Submission Form, selecting "Implementation" from the dropdown, listing the email addresses of all group members, and providing the link to your GitHub repo.

## Project Presentations

See the Freestyle Project Demonstration deliverable requirements for more details.

Prepare a slideshow in Google Slides. See deliverable requirements for details. Your presentation should be around 5-6 minutes in length total, so around 5-7 slides total. Upload your slides here in PDF format by the due date.

Our Demo Day is scheduled on ____ from ____ to ___. We will be Zoom-only during this time.

If you would like to prerecord your presentation (for example using Zoom recording), then you must upload your MP4 file here before the due date. Otherwise you will give your presentation live via Zoom on Demo Day.

The Demo Day Schedule is here. Please indicate if you will be presenting in person or prerecorded.
