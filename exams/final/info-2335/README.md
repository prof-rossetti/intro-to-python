# Final Exam (NYU INFO 2335)

## Description

The final exam is designed to evaluate students' knowledge of programming concepts, software development practices, and technology management concepts.

The exam will be administered during the first 90 minutes of a designated class period. The exam will be administered in paper format, so students should remember to bring a pen or pencil. The exam is "closed book" and students will not be allowed to consult any outside sources of information during the exam period.

The exam consists primarily of free-response questions, but may also contain multiple-choice and matching questions. Details about the contents of the final exam will be announced during class. But generally anything discussed in class is fair game, as well as anything in the [notes](/notes), slides, exercises, or projects. However the following concepts will be important to review:

  + [Information Systems](/notes/info-systems)
  + [Software](/notes/software)
  + Python Programming:
    + [Variables](/notes/python/variables.md)
    + [Control Flow](/notes/python/control-flow.md)
    + [Functions](/notes/python/functions.md) (defining and invoking, with or without parameters)
    + [Datatypes](/notes/python/datatypes/README.md):
      + [Lists](/notes/python/datatypes/lists.md) (including sorting, filtering, and mapping)
      + [Dictionaries](/notes/python/datatypes/dictionaries.md) (including nested structures)

Students may consult these exams from previous semesters in an effort to understand the kinds of questions that might be asked:

## Submission Instructions

Each student should hand-in their exam booklet to the professor when finished.

## Evaluation Methodology

The relative weights of each question on the exam will be denoted on the exam's cover page.

When asked to write Python code, students will be expected to do so with precision, but if there are syntax errors the professor will award partial credit based on the severity of the error(s). So students are encouraged to try their best even if they don't remember the exact answer.
