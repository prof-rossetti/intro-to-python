# "Freestyle" Project - Investigation

> See: [The "Freestyle" Project](README.md)

## Goals

Define the requirements and objectives of your proposed solution, and investigate the technical feasibility of your idea.

## Instructions

Brainstorm some project ideas you are interested in. Most likely you may wish to fetch and process data from an API or website. It is possible you may want to do some analysis on a work-related dataset. Or maybe you want to create a game of some kind.

In many cases, you will be able to investigate your idea in a Colab notebook, however in the event the packages you are using are only suited for local development, you can submit a GitHub repository instead, rather than a Colab notebook.

In your investigation deliverable, your goal is to demonstrate the feasability of your project idea, and learn more about the details of implementing your idea. In the event you have multiple options for a data source (for example choosing between many weather-related APIs), you might research multiple data sources and try to get data from them all in order to decide which approach is easiest or most desirable. In many cases, you will want to demonstrate your ability to fetch some data of interest, and start processing it in a simple example way.

By investigating your project idea, we decrease "what we know we don't know" and "what we don't know we don't know", thus lowering the risk involved in your project, and helping development progress in an efficient manner moving forward.

## Scoping and Prioritization

If your idea has multiple components, for example fetching data (or capturing some other information inputs), and then exporting it via email (or producing some other information outputs), then consider splitting up the work using a "divide and conquer" strategy, whereby one person focuses on fetching the data, and the other focuses on sending some example emails using dummy data. Then you can meet in the middle later, during your project implementation, to connect the component pieces. 

Alternatively you can consider a "pair programming" strategy, whereby all group members work on the same thing at the same time. For example one group member might be writing code (i.e. the "driver"), and another can be looking up documentation and assisting with troubleshooting (i.e. the "navigator").
