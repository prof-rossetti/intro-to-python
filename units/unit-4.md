# Unit 4: Datastores, and Processing CSV Data

> Prerequisites: [Python Language Overview](unit-3.md)

## Learning Objectives

In this unit, we'll illustrate the concept of program-data independence as we explore integrations between software and datastores. We'll focus on the Comma-separated Values (CSV) data format and learn how to use Python to process CSV data.

  + Processing Data:
    + [The `itertools` Module](/notes/python/modules/itertools.md)
  + [Managing Packages w/ the `pip` Utility](/notes/clis/pip.md)
  + Processing CSV Files:
    + [The `csv` Module](/notes/python/modules/csv.md)
    + [The `pandas` Package](/notes/python/packages/pandas.md)
  + Processing Data in other Formats (just for your awareness):
    + [The `json` Module](/notes/python/modules/json.md) (for processing JSON)
    + [The `BeautifulSoup` Package](/notes/python/packages/beautifulsoup.md) (for processing XML and HTML)
    + [The `pdftotext` Utility](/notes/clis/pdftotext.md) (for parsing PDFs)
    + [The `fpdf` Package](/notes/python/packages/fpdf.md) (for generating PDFs)
    + [The `psycopg` Package](/notes/python/packages/psycopg.md) (for PostgreSQL databases)
