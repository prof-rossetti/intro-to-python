# Unit 4B: Dataviz and Business Analytics

> Prerequisites: [Datastores, and Processing CSV Data](unit-4.md)

> NOTE: this unit is provided as optional bonus material for students interested in dataviz, statistics, natural language processing, and machine learning

## Learning Objectives

In this unit, we'll learn how to use Python to create business intelligence and analytics tools. We'll use third-party Python packages to analyze and visualize insights gleaned from CSV data. We'll also get more familiar with taking an active, independent learning approach.
