# Unit 0: Onboarding

Welcome to this Introductory Python course! To prepare for the first class, please complete all of the onboarding activities below.

## GitHub

Unless you already have one, please take a moment to [create a GitHub account](https://github.com/). We'll use this platform to manage, share, and submit different versions of our Python projects.

Afterwards, consider signing up for the [GitHub Student Developer Pack](https://education.github.com/pack), which provides some free resources.

> PRIVACY OPTIONS: Many students wish to associate their personal identities with their GitHub accounts, to display a portfolio of programming projects. However, if you're concerned about privacy, you have a few options. First, consider choosing a GitHub username which is different than your university-issued net identifier. Second, avoid uploading any personally-identifiable information to your GitHub profile. Third, sign up for the Student Developer Pack, which will allow you to submit projects via private repositories.

## Text Editor

Unless you already have a programming-class text editor of choice, please install the [VS Code text editor](https://code.visualstudio.com/). We'll use this software to save and edit files of Python code. See the professor's [VS Code basic configuration reference](/notes/devtools/vs-code.md#basic-configuration) for more details.

## Anaconda

Anaconda provides various command-line utilities for installing and managing different versions of the Python programming language and its third-party packages.

Unless it is already installed, download [Anaconda Version 3.7](https://www.anaconda.com/download) for either Mac or Windows. During the installation, you should remember to check the option to "Add Anaconda to my PATH environment variable". See the professor's [Anaconda installation reference](/notes/clis/conda.md#installation) for more details.

## GitHub Desktop

Unless you already have a Git client of choice, please install the [GitHub Desktop software](https://desktop.github.com/) and login with your GitHub account credentials. We'll use this software to upload our Python projects to the GitHub platform. See the professor's [GitHub Desktop configuration reference](/notes/devtools/github-desktop.md#configuration) for more details.

## Git

GitHub Desktop software will require the Git command-line utility to be installed on our computers. So let's install Git now. See the professor's [Git installation reference](/notes/clis/git.md#installation) for more details.

This installation should also install a program called Git Bash, which Windows users will use as their default command-line computing application.
