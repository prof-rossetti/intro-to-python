# "Version Control" Exercise

## Learning Objectives

In this exercise, we'll practice incorporating version control into our development workflow.

## Prerequisites

This exercise assumes you have already followed the [Onboarding Guide](/units/unit-0.md) to:
  1. Sign up for a GitHub account.
  2. Install and configure a Git client, such as the Git CLI or GitHub Desktop software.
  3. Install and configure a command-line application, such as Terminal or Git Bash.
  4. Install and configure a text editor, such as VS Code.
  5. Familiarize yourself with [command-line computing](/exercises/command-line-computing/README.md).

## Instructions

  1. On GitHub.com, create a new repository named something like "my-first-repo", and include a "README.md" file. We'll refer to this as the "remote repository".
  2. Use your Git client to "clone" (download) the remote repository onto your local machine, perhaps onto the Desktop. We'll refer to this as the "local repository".
  3. Use the command-line to navigate into the local repository.
  4. Open the local repository with your text editor.
  5. Use your text editor to edit the README.md file in some way. Remember to save the file when you're done editing.
  6. Use your Git Client to "make a commit" (save a new version) with a message like "Setup project repository".
  7. Use your Git Client to "push" the changes to GitHub / sync with the remote repository.

## Success Criteria

Once you see the changes reflected in your remote project repository on GitHub.com, you have succeeded. Repeat steps 5-7 two more times for good measure.
