# Tech Meetup Event Summary

## Learning Objectives

  1. Explore your local technology community.
  2. Network with technology industry professionals.
  3. Increase awareness of industry practices.

## Instructions

Identify a meetup event that is related to business, startups, and/or technology in general. Focus on Python and/or software-related events if possible. 

The event should take place in your city, in the area near where you live, or it could potentially be an online remote event (but prefer in person events). 

To find events, you could search sites like [meetup.com](http://www.meetup.com/), [eventbrite.com](https://www.eventbrite.com/), or your school's events page. As you consider which event to attend, you are encouraged to post links to interesting events in the `#meetups` Slack channel, where you can also try to identify a group of other students to attend the event with.

Attend the event. Prefer to attend with a group of other students or friends (try to avoid going alone).

After attending, write a short (1-3 page) summary of your experiences, to address at least the following questions:

 + Which event(s) did you attend, and which group(s) hosted them?
 + What happened during each event? What relevant topics were discussed?
 + How did the event discussions relate to your own skills and interests?
 + What did you learn about contemporary industry challenges and practices?

Embed photos to provide further evidence of event attendance (for example, a "selfie" that features distinguishable event imagery in the background).

## Submission Instructions

Create a single PDF file containing your write-up and images, and upload the PDF document to the learning management system (i.e. Canvas, Brightspace, or Blackboard).

## Evaluation Methodology

Full credit for submitting a thoughtful response that demonstrates
 **evidence** of event attendance AND
 **insights** into contemporary business and technology issues and practices.

## Alternate Assignment - Informational Interviews

If the idea of attending business and technology community events makes you uncomfortable, or if your schedule prohibits you from attending events before the end of the semester,
 you have another option. You may substitute a meetup event with an informational interview with some active member within the business and technology community.

After each interview, write a short (1-3 page) summary of your experiences,
to address questions like the following:

+ Which professional(s) did you interview? Include their contact info and a description of their professional roles/duties.
+ How are their professions relevant to the business/technology community?
+ What happened during each interview? What relevant topics were discussed?
+ How did your discussions relate to your own skills and interests?
+ What did you learn about contemporary industry challenges and practices?

Ideally embed photos or screenshots to provide further evidence of interview participation.
