# "Run the App" Exercise

## Prerequisites

This exercise assumes you have already:
  1. Gained familiarity with Git repositories by completing the [Version Control Exercise](/exercises/hello-world/version-control.md).
  2. Read about [Environment Variables](/notes/environment-variables.md).

## Learning Objectives

In this exercise, we'll learn how to install, configure, and run an existing Python application.

## Instructions

  1. Visit the Professor's ["My First Python App" repository](https://github.com/prof-rossetti/my-first-python-app), which contains a simple command-line game of Rock-Paper-Scissors. We'll refer to the Professor's repository as the "upstream repository".
  2. Click "Fork" to copy the repo under your own control. We'll refer to your forked copy as the "remote fork".
  3. Follow the instructions in the repository's "README.md" file to install, setup and run the Python game contained inside:
     1. Use your Git client to "clone" (download) the remote fork onto your local machine, perhaps onto the Desktop. We'll refer to this as the "local repository".
     2. Use the command-line to navigate into the local repository.
     3. Use an environment variable to customize the player name. Pass the environment variable from the command-line, or use your text editor to add a new ".env" file into the local repository and store your environment variable there.
     4. Run the Python file to play the game.

## Success Criteria

Once you have played a command-line game of Rock-Paper-Scissors, you will have succeeded. Play few more rounds for good measure, optionally further customizing the player name.
