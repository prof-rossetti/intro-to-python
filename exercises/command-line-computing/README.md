# "Command-line Computing" Exercise

Before we start learning about Python or software development, we need to achieve a basic level of familiarity with the command-line. Throughout the semester, we will be using the command-line to navigate and manage our computer's filesystem. We'll also be using it to execute Python scripts and other command-line utilities (CLIs).

## Instructions

Follow along with one of the following OS-specific guides:

  + [Using Terminal on Mac OS](mac-terminal.md) (or Git Bash on Windows)
  + [Using Command Prompt on Windows OS](windows-command-prompt.md)

> NOTE: commands are different on Mac vs Windows OS. Software repositories will often only list Mac-style commands, and the professor will default to sharing Mac-style commands. So students using Windows OS should also familiarize themselves with the Mac OS command equivalents. Students using Windows OS are encouraged to use Git Bash as their command-line application of choice, where they will have an opportunity to use the Mac-style commands.

> QUICK COMMAND-LINE TIPS:
>   + press the up arrow to cycle through recent commands
>   + press "tab" to auto-complete filepaths
>   + type "clear" and press "enter" (or just "command + k" on Mac) to clear the screen
