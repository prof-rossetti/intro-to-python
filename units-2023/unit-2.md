# Unit 2: Python Language Overview

## Learning Objectives

In this unit, we will take a high-level guided tour of the Python programming language. We'll start by familiarizing ourselves with some introductory Python reference materials, then we'll illustrate and apply these concepts as we work through a guided Python exercise.
