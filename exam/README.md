# Exam Prep

## Description

The exam is designed to evaluate a student's knowledge of Python programming concepts and software development practices. It covers material from the first module.

The exam will be administered in paper format, so students should remember to bring a pen or pencil. The exam is "closed book" and students should not consult any outside sources of information during the exam period.

The exam consists primarily of free-response questions, but may also contain multiple-choice and matching questions.

In terms of content, anything discussed in class is fair game, as well as any accompanying notes, slides, exercises, and projects (including walkthrough screencasts). The following concepts and techniques are of particular importance:

  + [Information Systems](/notes/info-systems/README.md)
  + Python Programming:
    + [Variables](/notes/python/variables.md)
    + [Control Flow](/notes/python/control-flow.md)
    + [Functions](/notes/python/functions.md) (defining and invoking, with or without parameters)
    + [Datatypes](/notes/python/datatypes/README.md):
      + [Lists](/notes/python/datatypes/lists.md) (including sorting, filtering, and mapping)
      + [Dictionaries](/notes/python/datatypes/dictionaries.md) (including nested structures)

Students may consult these past exams in an effort to understand what kinds of questions might be asked:

## Submission Instructions

Each student should hand-in their exam booklet to the professor when finished.

## Evaluation Methodology

The relative weights of each question on the exam will be denoted on the exam's cover page.

When asked to write Python code, students will be expected to do so with precision, but if there are syntax errors the professor will award partial credit based on the severity of the error(s). So students are encouraged to try their best even if they don't remember the exact answer.
